Experimental Java "tuple soup".

Credit for the phrase "tuple soup" should go to David Bennett at http://www.andl.org/, @Andras at https://tutel.me/c/programming/questions/27240345/database+table+relationship+design and probably others.

A "tuple soup" is a mutable collection of arbitrary tuples; sets of tuples may be retrieved via a predicate expression that evaluates to true for each retrieved tuple.

It is related to tuple spaces, the blackboard metaphor, and associative memory.
